\title{Identify Boundary Layers.}
\usage{
boundary_layers(faces, mask, boundary_width = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{faces}{a V x 3 matrix of integers. Each row defines a face by the index
of three vertices.}

\item{mask}{A length \eqn{V} logical vector indicating if each vertex is
within the input mask.}

\item{boundary_width}{a positive integer representing the width of the boundary
to compute. The furthest vertices from the input mask will be this number of
edges away from the closest vertex in the input mask. Default: \code{10}.}
}
\value{
a length-V numeric vector. Each entry corresponds to the vertex
with the same index. For vertices within the boundary, the value will be the
number of vertices away from the closest vertex in the input mask.
Vertices inside the input mask but at the edge of it (touching vertices with
value 1) will have value 0. All other vertices will have value -1.
}
\description{
Identify the vertices within \code{boundary_width} edges of the input mask.
The mesh must be triangular.

\title{Vertex Adjacency Matrix}
\usage{
vert_adjacency(faces, v1, v2 = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{faces}{a V x 3 matrix of integers. Each row defines a face by the index
of three vertices.}

\item{v1, v2}{The first and second set of vertices. These are logical vectors
the same length as \code{vertices} indicating the vertices in each set.
If \code{v2} is \code{NULL} (default), set \code{v2} to \code{v1}. Can
alternatively be a vector if integers corresponding to vertex indices.}
}
\value{
Adjacency matrix
}
\description{
Make adjacency matrix between two sets of vertices.

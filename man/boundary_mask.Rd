\title{Boundary Mask}
\usage{
boundary_mask(faces, mask, boundary_width)
}
\arguments{
\item{faces}{a V x 3 matrix of integers. Each row defines a face by the index
of three vertices.}

\item{mask}{A length \eqn{V} logical vector indicating if each vertex is
within the input mask.}

\item{boundary_width}{a positive integer. Vertices no more than this number
of edges from any vertex in the input mask will be placed in the boundary mask.}
}
\value{
The boundary mask, a length-V logical vector. TRUE indicates vertices
within the boundary mask.
}
\description{
Identify the vertices within \code{boundary_width} edges of the input mask. The
faces must be triangular.
